# personal-expense-tracker
This is a Personal Expense Tracker that can be used by users to store their monthly expenditures using the table provided and can easily track their savings on a monthly basis.  The goal of this project is to help the user develop the habit of tracking their expenses to save more and plan well for the upcoming months.

I have made a table that lets the user to enter each month's income, expenses for Groceries, Fuel, Bills (Electricity Bill, Water Bill, etc..), Rent, and Miscellaneous Expenses.The table will also calculate and show the savings for each month and it's percentage. The user can also Edit and Delete each record in the table

I have also attached a line graph corresponding to the table that shows savings percentage increase or decrease compared to every month.

I will be updating this project regularly as I gain more knowledge on how-to. 
Please feel free to review the project and suggest changes.
